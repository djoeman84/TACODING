 * File: BlankKarel.java
 * ---------------------
 * This is a blank Karel project that you can change at will. Remember, if you change
 * the class name, you'll need to change the filename so that it matches.
 * If you want to make the program load with a specific world, make the
 * world file named the same as this class. For example, when this program is
 * run, it would try to load BlankKarel.w if there is one.
