1. When discussing instance variables in lecture, we stressed that instance
   variables should be a "weapon of last resort" when communicating data
   around in a program. It's almost always preferable to use parameter passing
   and return values to move data between different parts of the program. For
   each instance variable in your program, explain why you chose to make it an
   instance variable rather than a local variable. (Constants don't count as
   instance variables, so you don't need to describe the constants in your
   program.)
  

 
   
2. The Breakout game ends either when the user loses three balls or when all
   the bricks are broken. How did you test whether the game would end correctly
   in this second case? Did you make any changes to the code when testing?
